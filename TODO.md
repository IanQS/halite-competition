# TODOs

# MyBot.cpp

- refactor and remove redundancies in code


# Implementation

## Jittering

1) The agents don't need to be greedy - currently, they move between all cardinal directions to the max, but moving costs halite

## over time 

1) increase the amount required before they head back
    - long journeys require halite to reach the base 

2) increase the threshold before they flip
    - they will start needing more and more time to get to new halite
